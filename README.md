# Deep Learning Project
In this repository i save some of project that i learn in Coursera Deep Learning Specialization,
here i only store some project that i thing important because some other projects are really spesific on what kind of Deep Learning you want to achieve.
i think further i will add other project that i've already learn in the course.

## Objectives
- Build Neep Neural Network
- Deep Neural Network Implementation (Image Classification)
- Deep Learning Optimization Methods
- Tensorflow
